# About Us

**St. Anthony’s College, Kandy Old Boys Association – Qatar**

St. Anthony's College Kandy, Old Boys' Association of Qatar was formed in 2009 by Aloy Cooray accompanied with Manoharan Arasu. Both of them adored about a social gather in Qatar. Their efforts resulted in 28th Of September 2009 since they were able to hold the first meeting with another 8 Old Antonians whom they have met in and around Doha.

## Inaugural Meeting

During the first meeting they nominated Aloy Cooray as the president and Manoharan Arasu as the secretary. While Saffan Mohammed was elected as the Treasurer. Saliya Tennakoon, Rizkhan Dhalan, Mohammed Shafraz, T.K Hanan and Anurudha Ellepola were among the committee members of the SACKOBA Qatar inaugural meeting.

Since then they have striven actively to develop the SACKOBA Qatar and gathered as many members as possible who reside in Doha. The association might never have come into existence without their dedication.

## First Gathering

As a result, on 4th June 2010, SACKOBA Qatar organized their 1st gathering with another 25 Antonians. The firm foundation was a Re-union Boat trip which is remarkable and extraordinary. There were many members who have helped towards the growth of this Association. Organizing charity events, Sports Events and Social events made the Antonian feel alive while they are away from their home. And it has been a great bond and experience between each member.

## Constitution and First Executive Committee

Amidst all the challenges, the SACKOBA Qatar constitution prepared by Aloy J Cooray & Riyas Tajudeen was obtained Approval from the Parent Body & the St.Anthonys College Kandy Former Principal Rev Fr . Titus Rodrigo. The draft constitution was amended and adopted unanimously. This was followed by the election of the first executive committee for the financial year 2010. The first official executive committee was led by Aloy Cooray.

## Event in Al-ishan Hotel

In October 2010, the newly appointed SACKOBA Qatar executive committee organized a colorful event in Al-ishan hotel Doha where around 40 Antonians marked their presence to grace the occasion. Our Former patron Rev. Fr Vincent Wijesuriya was the chief guest of the event who attended, all the way from Dubai. It was another successful event followed by a gala dinner.

## Membership

In order to accommodate our association's continuing rapid growth over the years, we introduced a membership format in which the SACKOBA Qatar members gain recognition in our OBA parent body back in Sri Lanka. We have implemented membership for all Antonians residing in Qatar. Even the past teachers of the alma mater can obtain membership as honorary members of the association, while they have no voting rights.

## Annual Trip to Al-Shamal Beach

During the Eid holidays in November 2010, SACKOBA Qatar organized an annual trip to the al-shamal beach in Doha. It was a fun-filled family gathering witnessed by all who participated. On 21st December 2010, we moved another step forward since SACKOBA Qatar has affiliated with the Srilankan embassy in Qatar.

## Growth and Objectives

During the last few years, we have grown by leaps and bounds. Today our membership stands at 81. It was decided at the outset that the main objectives of the Association are to build diversified and supportive social connections among the Srilankans & Old Antonians residing in Qatar and to facilitate united action to support the College and the parent body in the best possible way on various projects undertaken by them.

## Support and Annual General Meetings

Since its inception, the Association has thrived on the support of the loyal Antonians in Qatar and on the hard work of successive committees and their families. The Annual General Meetings followed by dinner have become a happy social occasion which loyal Antonians and their families make it a point to attend. During the AGM & annual get together-2011, which was held at Mercure Grand Hotel - Doha, GIhan Rodrigo and Riyas thajudeen were specially honored by the SACKOBA Qatar for their dedication and commitment towards the growth of the association.

## Sporting Achievements

During 2012 and 2013, SACKOBA Qatar clinched three main titles in the sporting arena which includes the Doha Lions Cricket Champions Trophy - 2012 and the Doha Lions Tag Rugby Tournament Runner up trophy 2013. This victory has pushed us forward to be one of the leading, out of 16 foremost schools OBA in Qatar.

## Social Initiatives

On the social front, SACKOBA Qatar will continue its efforts to address social concerns. We have introduced 'Building Future,' a primary education scholarship scheme, with the objective of enabling and providing access to primary education for students finishing Secondary school at St. Anthony’s College Kandy.

## Community Involvement

SACKOBA Qatar has been involved in many projects carried out by the Srilankan community in Doha. Whenever the need arises, SACKOBA Qatar should not shy away from its obligation to help and protect their own community.
