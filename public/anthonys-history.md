# The History of St. Anthony’s College, Kandy

The history of St. Anthony’s College, Kandy is a remarkable tale of resilience, dedication, and excellence. This prestigious institution’s journey began in the 19th century and has left an indelible mark on the education landscape of Sri Lanka.

## Early Years

Catholic missionaries first arrived in Kandy, despite the British colonial rule following the kingdom’s fall in 1815. Notably, it was **Rev. Fr. Felice Zoppi**, a Franciscan hailing from the Chinese missionary field, who ventured to Kandy in 1853 under the guidance of **Monsignor Joseph Bravi**. In 1854, he established an English school at the current location of St. Anthony’s Cathedral in Kandy, marking the birth of St. Anthony’s School. The school’s motto, “LUX DE COELO” meaning “Light from Heaven,” symbolised its noble mission.

In 1867, St. Anthony’s School received a Grant-in-Aid from the Schools Commission, thanks to the relentless efforts of **Monsignor Hilarian Sillani**, a scholarly and influential preacher from Italy. **Abbot Pancrazi**, the Superior of St. Anthony’s Monastery, played a pivotal role in acquiring the school’s property in Kandy. **Monsignor Clement Pagnani** constructed the first boarding house in 1876.

## Growth and Development

The student population at St. Anthony’s experienced significant growth during these early years. By 1884, it had doubled, and by 1894, the school had become a well-established educational institution in Kandy. Prominent figures such as **Rev. Fathers D. H. Vandestraaten**, **D. Paul Perera**, and **D. M. Craner**, as well as **R. P. Jansz**, contributed to the school’s success during this period.

**Fr. Hilarian Leitan OSB** was appointed as Principal in 1892, marking the beginning of an unbroken chain of Benedictine Priest Principals. **Fr. Maurus Craner**, the first Old Boy Principal, served from 1898 to 1906.

In a relatively short time, Brothers **Rev. Frs. Phillip Caspersz** (Principal 1907-1914) and **James Caspersz** (Principal 1916-1921) elevated the school’s status to that of a college. They introduced sports like cricket, football, and hockey to the curriculum. The first prize-giving took place in 1907, and in 1914, St. Anthony’s College triumphed in the first Trinity-Antonian Cricket encounter.

The College’s first journal, “**St. Anthony’s Annual**,” debuted in 1908 and was later renamed “**The Antonian**” in 1916. In December, 1910 the Old Boys’ Association was founded by **Rev. Fr. Basil Hyde**, who would later serve as Principal from 1915-16. **Rt Rev Bishop Beekmeyer** was the first president of the OBA.

The introduction of boxing in 1914 added another dimension to the school’s sporting achievements. During **Fr. James Caspersz’s** tenure, the school underwent significant expansion, including the opening of a new wing in 1916, complete with laboratory facilities for Physics and Chemistry.

In 1917, the Department of Education officially recognised St. Anthony’s as a fully organised secondary school. The prize-giving of 1917 was held under the patronage of **Sir Alexander Wood Renton**, the Chief Justice of Ceylon. The school excelled in sports, with notable achievements by **Jack Anderson** in inter-school cricket.

During the 1920s, the current College Anthem, “**Rally Round the Banner of the College**,” came into use, composed by an Old Antonian, **Charles Robinson**.

## Move to Katugastota

In 1921, **Rev. Fr. Lawrence Hyde**, an old Antonian, succeeded **Fr. James Caspersz** as the Principal. This marked the beginning of a new era for St. Anthony’s College. **Fr. Hyde** sought a more spacious site for the College, and in 1927, **Bishop Beekmeyer** purchased 27 acres of the Dunuwila Walauwa at Katugastota, later adding six more acres. This site, with the majestic Mahaweli River, picturesque views of Hunnasgiriya and Hantana, and sprawling countryside, was a fitting location for the school.

The Colombo branch of the Old Boys’ Association was established in 1926. The school underwent extensive renovations in 1927, and on January 16, 1928, the junior boarders were installed. On January 29, 1928, the place was consecrated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. In his mission to transform the school, **Fr. Hyde** constructed the first set of classrooms along the river, now housing the Primary department. A significant milestone was achieved when St. Anthony’s obtained a 100 percent pass rate in the London Matriculation Examinations in 1934, creating a record in the British Empire.

The main parallel building blocks were opened in 1935, and the school’s playground began to take shape. **Rev. Fr. D. J. M. Berenger**, an Old Boy, initiated a scholarship fund to assist needy students. The Old Antonian Football team, led by **George Mackey**, won the “Winchester” and “Miller” cups in the Kandy League for several years.

In 1938, the prestigious “**Bede Gold Medal**” was introduced, awarded to the best all-round student. “**The Eagle**” was introduced as the highest Antonian award for sports. Maroon, Dark Blue and Light Blue are the school colours. The present House system was introduced in the 1930s.

## World War II and Aftermath

During World War II, on March 19, 1942, the school had to evacuate due to Government orders, as it was repurposed as a military hospital. The school continued to function, albeit scattered across various locations, mostly in the premises of P. B. A. Weerakoon.

After a 22-year tenure, **Fr. Lawrence Hyde** retired in 1944, succeeded by **Fr. Angelo Rosati**. The ceremonial return to College premises took place in 1946. **Fr. Theopane Wickramaratne** was instrumental in constructing key facilities such as the hostel units, Rainbow Cottage, Villa, Mansion, and also the Refectory, tuck shop and the chapel.
