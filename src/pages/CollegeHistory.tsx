    title: 'The Beginning',
    content: `The Roman Catholic Church had established itself in the Maritime areas from 1505. In 1820 the superior of all the Oratorians in Ceylon, Vincent de Rozairo, himself came as the first missionary to Kandy. He put up a church, which occupied the very same grounds whereon the present Scots Kirk stands. In 1828 the Scots Kirk site was found to be too small and hilly and accordingly a petition was submitted to the Governor - General Sir Edward Barnes who promptly presented the Catholic Church with a new site. It was roughly a square 152 ft. by 150 ft. upon which the second Roman Catholic Church was built. This is the very same site on which St. Anthony's Cathedral stands today.`,

    content: `It was realized that building churches alone would not contribute to the success of the missionary efforts that commenced in 1820. In September 1843, an Italian Oratorian, Fr. Orazio Bettacchini was sent to the Kandyan mission who, during his missionary year 1843/44, opened a school in Kandy on the same premises. But, in August 1844, his successor Fr. Reinaud, who continued as missionary until 1848, began his missionary career by pulling down the school, which Fr. Bettacchini had put up.

    In November 1853, Fr. Felice Zoppi, a Franciscan from the Chinese missionary field was sent to Kandy by Monsignor Joseph Maria Bravi. Fr. Zoppi promptly set about his task by opening a school for boys and one for girls at the house where he resided, in January of 1854, with a Mr. Van Twest as Head Teacher of the Boys School. This was the birth of St. Anthony's School.`,

Fr. Zoppi left the country at the end of September 1856. In the absence of sufficient missionaries to take over the school, which was then a parish school, a succession of laymen carried on the administration until 1870.

    In 1867, St. Anthony's Boys' School was referred as the 'second best school in English' among all the schools established by the Missionaries. In 1870, the Irish Christian Brothers John and Paul took over the administration, temporarily. The school continued to grow under various administrators until Fr. Dom Hildebrand Vanderstraaten O.S.B. was installed as Principal in 1875.`,
